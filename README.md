## About

This is a very simple proof of concept app for viewing anime and manga with the freely available [AniList GraphQL api](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/).

This isn't a very full featured client, my main goals with it were to:

- Practice GraphQL
- Practice tailwind css and responsive web design
- Use react-query to manage data fetching, as well as implement a nifty infinite scroll

### Built With

Here are some of the libraries and frameworks I used.

- React (create-react-app)
- react-query
- react-hook-form
- graphql-request
- tailwindcss 2.0

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

A recent version of node and npm.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the project
   ```sh
   npm start
   #or
   yarn start
   ```

## Roadmap

I may come back in the future and implement more features of the AniList api.
But for right now, this is a pretty simple and self contained example.
